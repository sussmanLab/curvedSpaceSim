@class baseHDF5Database 

This class interfaces with the hdf5 c-api to provide a few common functions.
It is specialized to almost entirely deal with 2D data (i.e., datasets of some number of columns, for which each row is another "record") .

The constructor handles the correct file access as a function of the desired filemode (readonly, readwrite, or replace),
and a few functions of convenience are provided.
Small amounts of information can be added to the header of the hdf5 file by the addHeaderData function,
Datasets that can store an arbitrary number of records can be added by first
registering them (registerExtendableDataset(...)) and then writing the data (extendDataset(...)). 
The ability to read specific rows of datasets is also provided (readDataset(...)).
All functions are currently templated, with explicit instantiation for ints, floats, and doubles.

This class will mostly be used in the context of derived classes that, for instance, might set up the
reproducible structures to save snapshots with positions / velocities in a simulation, etc.
